## üìå Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **Design and Implementation of Software Systems** course at **Technische Universit√§t Hamburg (TU Hamburg)**.

The system involves a **LEGO LeJOS Mindstorms EV3 robot** designed to autonomously solve a maze by navigating from any random starting point within a confined 35x35 cm¬≤ grid. The robot utilizes multiple sensors to detect obstacles, identify colors, and maintain orientation in order to reach a designated **goal wall of a specific color**.

## üéØ Objective

Guide the robot from an arbitrary starting position in a maze to a **target location marked by a specific color**, using:
- Sensor input for environmental awareness
- Decision-making logic based on the "Left First" algorithm
- Precise motor control and navigation

## üîß Key Features

- Autonomous maze solving using a **"Left First" exploration strategy**
- Real-time **sensor-based navigation**:
  - **Gyroscope**: For orientation and turning accuracy
  - **Ultrasonic Sensor**: For obstacle and wall detection
  - **Color Sensor**: To identify the goal area
- Modular software architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Robust state management for decision-making and movement

## ü§ñ Hardware Components

- **LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Kit**
- **EV3 Gyro Sensor**: For directional control and turning precision
- **EV3 Ultrasonic Sensor**: Detects walls and obstacles
- **EV3 Color Sensor**: Identifies the goal area by color
- **Two Large Motors**: Control differential drive system

## üõ†Ô∏è Software Architecture

The software is implemented using **LeJOS EV3 firmware** in Java and follows a **modular design pattern**, separating responsibilities into distinct components:

- **Sensor Manager**: Handles data acquisition and filtering
- **Navigation Logic**: Implements the "Left First" maze-solving algorithm
- **Motor Controller**: Manages precise movements and turns
- **State Machine**: Coordinates robot behavior across different modes (e.g., exploring, turning, stopping)

## üß≠ Navigation Strategy: Left First Algorithm

The robot explores the maze by prioritizing left turns when possible. It makes decisions based on sensor inputs according to the following priority list:

1. **Turn Left** if possible
2. **Go Straight** if no left turn available
3. **Turn Right** if only right is open
4. **U-turn** if completely blocked

This ensures efficient coverage and eventual arrival at the goal.

## üéÆ Operation Workflow

1. **Start Up**: Robot initializes sensors and motors.
2. **Search Mode**: Begins navigating the maze using the "Left First" algorithm.
3. **Wall Detection**: Uses ultrasonic sensor to avoid collisions and track walls.
4. **Goal Detection**: Scans for the target color using the color sensor.
5. **Arrival**: Upon detecting the goal color, the robot stops and signals completion.
