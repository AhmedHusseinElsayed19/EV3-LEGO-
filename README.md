This project encompasses code designed for a Maze Solving LEGO Lejos Mindstorms EV3 robot. The robot is equipped with sensors for gyroscope-based orientation, obstacle detection via an Ultrasonic sensor, and color identification using a color sensor. The primary objective is to guide the robot in reaching a designated goal, represented by a wall of a specific color. This journey commences from any random starting point within a confined grid map measuring 35x35 square centimeters. The robot's navigation adheres to the "Left First" algorithm, ensuring an efficient path to the goal.
